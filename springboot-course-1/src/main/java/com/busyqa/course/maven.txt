What is Maven?

1. Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. 
2. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, 
   and other languages. 

3. Maven addresses two aspects of building software: 
   
   A. How software is built, 
   B. And its dependencies. 
   
4. Unlike earlier tools like Apache Ant, it uses conventions for the build procedure, 
   and only exceptions need to be written down. 
   
5. An XML file describes the software project being built, its dependencies on other 
   external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins. 
   
6. Maven dynamically downloads Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from one or more 
   repositories such as the Maven 2 Central Repository, and stores them in a local cache.
   
7. Alternative technologies like Gradle and sbt as build tools do not rely on XML, 
   but keep the key concepts Maven introduced.
